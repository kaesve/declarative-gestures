# Declarative gestures

This project is inspired by a paper [Proton: Multitouch Gestures as Regular Expressions](http://graphics.pixar.com/library/ProtonChi/paper.pdf). The paper describes a system to write multi-touch gestures by recognizing patterns in a stream of touch inputs with a regular expression like syntax. In this project I aim to implement a similar system for browsers, in javascript.
